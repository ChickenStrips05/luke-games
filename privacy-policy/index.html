  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 2, 2025<br />
  <strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 2, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Luke Games</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines what information we do and do not collect when you use our website, accessible at <a href="https://luke-games.glitch.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luke-games.glitch.me</a>, and how we handle and protect your data.</p>
  <p>By using our website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We have designed our website with privacy in mind. As such:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We <strong>do not collect</strong> any personal information (e.g., names, email addresses, phone numbers).</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not require</strong> users to create accounts or log in.</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not collect</strong> location data, IP addresses, device information, or browser details.</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not use</strong> cookies, local storage, or tracking technologies of any kind.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. No Use of Cookies or Analytics</h2>
    <p>We do not use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cookies</strong> (persistent or session-based)</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party analytics tools</strong> (such as Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Behavioral tracking mechanisms</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your visit to our site remains completely anonymous.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. No Advertisements or Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our site is <strong>ad-free</strong> and we do <strong>not partner with any advertising networks or third-party services</strong> that collect or process data. We do not serve third-party content (e.g., embedded videos, social media widgets) that might otherwise track your activity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. No Data Sales or Transfers</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not buy, sell, rent, share, or disclose</strong> any user data—because we don't collect any. Your browsing experience is entirely private.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Although our website may be suitable for users of all ages, including children, we do not knowingly collect any information from anyone—children or otherwise. As we do not collect data, we comply with the <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> by default.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Since no personal information is collected or stored on our servers, the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access is effectively nonexistent. However, we still use secure HTTPS protocols to encrypt data in transit and ensure a safe browsing experience.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If changes are made, the "Last Updated" date at the top of the policy will be revised. We recommend checking this page occasionally to stay informed.</p>
